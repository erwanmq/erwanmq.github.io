                I’m an aerospace engineer student loving programming, electronics and space domains.
                I am learning them thanks to online resources and personal projects. I will show you in this website.

                <h1>Solar System Simulation</h1>
                <p>
                    My very first real project was a solar system simulation. I studied programming after watching a video of a galaxy simulation and wanted to create my own, but in 2D.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For this project, I used SFML for graphics, creating circles and adding sprites. I included a star map for realism.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most challenging part was implementing the physics using Newton’s laws and describing the initial conditions of the planets.
