                I’m an aerospace engineer student loving programming, electronics and space domains.
                I am learning them thanks to online resources and personal projects. I will show you in this website.

                <h1>Solar System Simulation</h1>
                <p>
                    My very first real project was a solar system simulation. I studied programming after watching a video of a galaxy simulation and wanted to create my own, but in 2D.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For this project, I used SFML for graphics, creating circles and adding sprites. I included a star map for realism.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most challenging part was implementing the physics using Newton’s laws and describing the initial conditions of the planets.

                <h1>Sudoku Solver</h1>
                <p>
                    After my simulation, I wanted to do some automation. I was always bad at Sudoku, but I know how to program. Consequently, I created a program using OpenCV to load a PNG sudoku image, then process it to solve it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It works for some images, but I was still in my beginnings, so when the image is not nice cropped, or with a good constract, it bugs. For this reason, I added another method, we enter the numbers in the terminal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The algorithm used is named backtracking. This algorithm starts to the top left of the sudoku, put the number one, move on cell to the bot and add two. If it can’t find a number, he goes back and change the previous number.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here is a video showing the algorithm in action :  <a href="https://youtu.be/oTrtURw761k">Sudoku Solver</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The program is slow because he has to draw every cell. But without displaying this video, he finished the sudoku in some seconds.

                <h1>Autonomous Telescope</h1>
                <p>
                    During my scholarship, we did some school projects in group. One of them was a micro-controller project with an Arduino. We decided with a colleague to create a Telescope in 3D printing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our goal was to create a program that takes in entry 2 star coordinates, declination and ascension. It could move the telescope with a servomotor and a stepmotor to the right position and target the star.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The current and future position was printed on a LCD screen. The coordinates was entered by a Bluetooth module thanks to an Android application on our smartphones.

                <h1>The Airship</h1>
                <p>
                    I did two airship projects. The first one was a school project with 6 students for a week. The last one, the biggest, is a Planète Sciences project with 13 students of my school. The goal is to build an airship (not the structure but electronics, objects,…) of 6 meters long.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The mission of this airship is to pick up objects (container, pales and a rod) to build a little structure. There is also some other tests like speed test or stability test.

                <h1>Food consumption expiration date</h1>
                <p>
                    One of my big last project is a mix of a lot of domain. It is a Raspberry PI, that can scan the bar-code of food bought in a market to store its expiration date in a database.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This information is printed to a tactile LCD with the closest expiration date at the top. The user can see which food is already expired and can remove it from the fridge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It uses one camera that can scan bar-code, scan the expiration date and uses the OpenFoodFact API to get information about the product.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a 3D printed box with a magnet, it can be attached to the fridge.
