                <h1>Solar System Simulation</h1>
                <p>
                    My very first real project was a solar system simulation. I studied programming after watching a video of a galaxy simulation and wanted to create my own, but in 2D.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For this project, I used SFML for graphics, creating circles and adding sprites. I included a star map for added realism.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most challenging part was implementing the physics using Newton’s laws and describing the initial conditions of the planets.

                <h1>Sudoku Solver</h1>
                <p>
                    After my simulation, I wanted to do some automation. I've always been bad at Sudoku, but I know how to program. Consequently, I created a program using OpenCV to load a PNG sudoku image, then process it to solve it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It works for some images, but I was still in my beginnings, so when the image is not nice cropped, or with a good constract, it bugs. For this reason, I added another method, we enter the numbers in the terminal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The algorithm used is named backtracking. This algorithm starts to the top left of the sudoku, put the number one, move on cell to the bot and add two. If it can’t find a number, he goes back and change the previous number.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here is a video showing the algorithm in action :  <a href="https://youtu.be/oTrtURw761k">Sudoku Solver</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The program is slow because he has to draw every cell. But without displaying this video, he finished the sudoku in some seconds.

                <h1>Autonomous Telescope</h1>
                <p>
                    During my schooling, we did some school projects in groups. One of them was a microcontroller project with an Arduino. A colleague and I decided to create a Telescope in 3D printing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our goal was to create a program that took into account the coordinates of 2 stars, the declination and ascension. It could move the telescope with a servo motor and a stepper motor to the right position and aim at the star.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The current and future position was printed on a LCD screen. The coordinates was entered by a Bluetooth module using an Android application on our smartphones.

                <h1>The Airship</h1>
                <p>
                    I have completed two airship projects. The first one was a school project with 6 students for a week. The last one, the biggest, is a Planète Sciences project with 12 students from my school. The goal is to build an airship (not the structure but electronics, objects, etc.) 6 meters long.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The mission of this airship is to collect objects (container, pales and a rod) to build a small structure. There are also other tests like the speed test or the stability test. After several months of work with my team of 12 and 3 RCE, we were able to participate in the final.
                    The final was very intensive because we had to finish all our work. We had a lot of difficulties but at the end of the day, we were on the podium at the third place. There were 7 teams. Some already partipated to this project. So we were very proud to be at this position!

                <h1>Food consumption expiration date</h1>
                <p>
                    One of my recent big projects is a mix of several fields. It is a Raspberry PI, which can scan the barcode of food bought at the market to store its expiration date in a database.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This information is printed on a touch LCD display with the nearest expiration date at the top. The user can see which food are already expired and can remove them from the refrigerator.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It uses a camera that can scan barcode, scan the expiration date and uses the OpenFoodFact API to get information about the product.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a 3D printed box with a magnet, it can be attached to the refrigerator.
                    For now, it is still a prototype with its breadboard. I will soon create a PCB to store all these wires, and create a box with a 3D printer. I wrote the 
                    driver of my LCD in C++ and can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/erwanmq/FoodRPi">Code.</a>
